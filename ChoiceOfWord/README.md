Found a simple console app for checking the longest word in a string.
I made some changes to the code to make it a little neater.

Rewrote this to find the shortest word.

Rewrote the code to allow the user to choose whether to choose the Longest or the shortest word.
This code also has a multi use statement. Allowing the user to re-run the code. 

If the string under test was changing as in webscrapes. Then this could be the base class.
