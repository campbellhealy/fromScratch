# JobSearcher
My take of a Node.JS tutorial I followed

This code was following the tutorial at youtube.com/watch?v=v7cprTuAnlA, please have a look, like it if you will.
The author has a repo with the code but other than the SVG, I hand-coded everything so that I could actually learn.

After following the tutorial, I tweaked it to suit my needs, using my own background and colours.

It uses a job accumulator site's API to pull a list of vacancies that link to the vacancy listing wherever that is.

The batch files: 
A master file is used to start the app, it opens two other bat files.
Note: This terminal gives a choice to run the web app or cancel the terminal.

The first is for NODE.JS server, this terminal is minimised and should run for the duration of the web app.
The second is for the webserver, this terminal is minimised and should run for the duration of the web app.

The file then opens up a web browser to the page needed. This is set to use the default browser rather than a set browser.
This initial terminal will now close.

Note: You will have to add in your own APP ID and API Key to get this code working, get it from Adzuna.
I also suggest to pull a shortcut for the jobsearch.bat file and drop it on your desktop/taskbar etc.
